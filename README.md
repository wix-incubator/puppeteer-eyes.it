# puppeteer-eyes.it

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wix-incubator/puppeteer-eyes.it.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wix-incubator/puppeteer-eyes.it)

Automatically compare screenshots for your [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/) tests, when using Jest as your test runner. All you have to do is use `eyes.it` ot `eyes.test` in your tests instead of `it` ot `test` and it will run the test with screenshots sent to [eyes](https://applitools.com/) at the end of the test.
